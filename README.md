My hobby programming language 

# What is Turbo?
Turbo is a simple programming language who's syntax makes use of [reverse polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) and compiles to a simple set of IR instructions.

This is primarily a sandbox for me to learn more about programming language design and development, as well as a sandbox for me to test my own language design ideas.
