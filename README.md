# Joint
My hobby programming language 

# What is Joint?
Joint is a simple programming language who's syntax makes use of [reverse polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) and compiles to a simple set of IR instructions.

This is primarily a sandbox for me to learn more about programming language design and development, as well as a sandbox for me to test my own language design ideas.

# Usage
You will need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) installed in order to compile and run Joint.

Run an example:
```
$ cargo run -- -i examples/fibonacci.tbo
```

# Special thanks
